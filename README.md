# About the Project üíª	

This project is an **interactive web application** to dynamically visualize MHN Patient History Trees, making it much easier to explore tumor evolution pathways in real time.

The web application allows users to upload and visualize MHN-inferred genetic event orders (History Trees) in tumors from CSV and JSON files. It is designed for scientists in biology, oncology, and bioinformatics, with or without programming background.


## What is MHN?	

The **Mutual Hazard Networks (MHNs) Algorithm** is a Cancer Progression Model (CPM) that takes into account both **promoting and inhibitory relationships** between genetic events as well as **cyclic dependencies**, enabling the reconstruction of **the most likely tumor evolution path for every tumor** in patient data. These paths can be visualized in History Trees üå≥.

<ins>The algorithm generates two files: </ins>

### üìÑ CSV - Theta Matrix

The CSV contains:
- **multiplicative effects** between genetic events, promoting as well as inhibitory
- the **base rate** (natural likelihood) of each genetic event to occur
- the **observation rate** (likelihood for the presence of a genetic event to lead to clinical detection of the tumor)

###  üìÑ JSON - History Tree

Based on the Theta Matrix, the algorithm infers the **order of occurence** of genetic events for History Tree, which is stored in the corresponding JSON file.

## Tech Stack üîß

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the MHN History Tree application uses:

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

- The History Tree is vizualized by using the package [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) with the [Collapsible Tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/collapsible-tree) template.

- The Theta Matrix is vizualized by using the package [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) with the [Heatmap with tooltip](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/heatmap_tooltip.html) template.

- To ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface, the UI component library [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) was used. 

- For code safety, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) was used.
